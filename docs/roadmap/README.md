## 🚀 Implementation Phases

### **Phase 1: Essential Features (High Priority)** 🔥

Focus on core developer experience improvements that provide immediate value:

1. ✅ **@nuxt/image Integration** - Image optimization and transformation
2. ✅ **Nuxt DevTools Integration** - Development debugging and monitoring
3. ✅ **Route-based Content Fetching Middleware** - Automatic content loading
4. **Auto-generated TypeScript Types** - Type safety and developer experience

### **Phase 2: Production Ready Features (Medium Priority)** ⚡

Add production-focused features for SEO and content management:

5. **Sitemap Integration** - SEO optimization with multilingual support

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

For each feature implementation:

- **TypeScript type checking** to ensure type safety
- **ESLint compliance** for code quality
- **Build verification** to ensure everything compiles correctly
- **Playground examples** with working demonstrations in `playground/app.vue`

## 🚀 Getting Started

To implement these features:

1. **Create a feature branch** - Each feature should be implemented in its own Git branch (e.g., `feat/nuxt-image-integration`, `feat/devtools-integration`)
2. **Start with Phase 1** - Focus on essential DX improvements
3. **Follow the detailed specifications** - Each feature has comprehensive implementation guides
4. **Use the provided code examples** - All major components have working code snippets. Make sure they are actually working, feel free to make better code.
5. **Test thoroughly** - Follow the testing strategy for each feature
6. **Document as you go** - Update README.md with new features
7. **Create pull requests** - Submit each feature as a separate PR for review
